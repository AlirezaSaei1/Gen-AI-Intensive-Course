# Capstone Project
This project implements an Autonomous Multi-Agent System designed to enhance the in-car user experience. Using LangGraph, it orchestrates interactions between specialized components: an Orchestrator Agent analyzes user requests, delegating tasks to specific Tools for navigation (using a custom map dataset), media control, communication, or retrieving vehicle information. Crucially, the VehicleInfo tool leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), searching a vector store containing the car manual's text using embeddings to answer specific questions about car features and troubleshooting. The system manages conversation flow, utilizes Function Calling to interact with tools, and aims to provide accurate, context-aware responses to the driver.
